# RLSSMysteryBoxes

A little passion project looking at the output and distribution of the returns on investment into the mystery boxes you can purchase in the mobile game Rocket League Sideswipe. 
I know this is a game for kids but damn it is fun and I have no shame in conducting this project.

The `data` file contains the dataset that I have collected from playing the game myself and am using to get my results in the .rmd file.
